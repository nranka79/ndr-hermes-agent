# WhatsApp URL Encoding — Research Notes

**Date:** 2026-05-03 (updated 2026-05-07, 2026-07-11)
**Status:** VERIFIED WORKING

## The Rule

**`api.whatsapp.com` is the default.** `wa.me` can be used with fullwidth character replacement (see below).

## Why Both `wa.me` AND `api.whatsapp.com` Break With `%26`

**⚠️ VERIFIED Jun 2026:** Mobile WhatsApp WebViews (Android/iOS) incorrectly parse `%26` (URL-encoded `&`) as a URL query separator on **BOTH** endpoints — not just `wa.me`. On Android, the native URL handler strips `%26` even from `api.whatsapp.com/send` URLs, truncating the message at the `&` character.

This applies regardless of endpoint:
- `%26` inside the `text=` parameter value → Android WhatsApp WebView treats it as a parameter separator → message truncated
- `&` between URL parameters (`phone=...&text=...`) stays unencoded — these are real parameter separators, not part of the message

## Correct Approach — Fullwidth Character Substitution for ALL WhatsApp Links

**⚠️ Both `%26` (ampersand) AND `%25` (percent) break on mobile WhatsApp WebViews.** Replace EVERY problematic character with its fullwidth Unicode equivalent BEFORE URL-encoding:

| Character | Standard | Fullwidth | Unicode | URL Encoding | Why |
|-----------|----------|-----------|---------|--------------|-----|
| `&` (Ampersand) | `&` | `＆` | U+FF06 | `%EF%BC%86` | `%26` interpreted as URL param separator → message truncated |
| `%` (Percent) | `%` | `％` | U+FF05 | `%EF%BC%85` | `%25` triggers double-decode → weird chars in message |
| `=` (Equals) | `=` | `＝` | U+FF1D | `%EF%BC%9D` | `%3D` can break query string parsing |
| `+` (Plus) | `+` | `＋` | U+FF0B | `%EF%BC%8B` | `+` interpreted as space by URL parsers |

**Universal recipe:**
```python
import urllib.parse

phone = '919900093816'  # strip + and spaces
# Replace ALL problematic characters BEFORE encoding
message = message.replace('&', '\uFF06')   # fullwidth ampersand
message = message.replace('%', '\uFF05')   # fullwidth percent
message = message.replace('=', '\uFF1D')   # fullwidth equals
message = message.replace('+', '\uFF0B')   # fullwidth plus
encoded = urllib.parse.quote(message, safe='')
link = f"https://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone={phone}&text={encoded}"
```

**Verify the correct hex:**
```python
import urllib.parse
print(urllib.parse.quote('\uFF06'))  # MUST print %EF%BC%86
print(urllib.parse.quote('\uFF05'))  # MUST print %EF%BC%85
print(urllib.parse.quote('\uFF0B'))  # MUST print %EF%BC%8B
```

## `whatsapp_link` TOOL STATUS — NOW HANDLES FULLWIDTH CORRECTLY

**Historical bug (fixed after 11 Jul 2026):** The built-in `whatsapp_link` tool used to emit raw `%26` for `&` characters which broke on Android WhatsApp WebViews. **This has been fixed.** The tool now performs fullwidth character substitution in `_encode_wa_text()` — after URL encoding, it replaces `%26` → `%EF%BC%86` (fullwidth ＆) and `%23` → `%EF%BC%83` (fullwidth ＃).

**Current behaviour (confirmed Jul 2026):** The `whatsapp_link` tool is SAFE to use for messages containing `&`, `%`, `=`, or `+`. It handles the encoding correctly.

**⚠️ Tool-access caveat:** The `whatsapp_link` tool is registered under the "messaging" toolset and may NOT appear in your direct tool list depending on your session configuration. If it's not in your function list, access it via `execute_code`:
```python
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, '/opt/hermes/tools')
from whatsapp_link_tool import whatsapp_link_tool
import json
result = json.loads(whatsapp_link_tool({"phone": "91XXXXXXXXXX", "text": "Message"}))
# result["url"] contains the wa.me link
```

Use `platform="telegram"` to get `display_link` (MarkdownV2-escaped inline link for Telegram delivery).

**Fallback (manual encoding):** When the tool is genuinely unavailable (not just missing from tool list), use the fullwidth substitution recipe in the "Correct Approach" section above.

## When to apply fullwidth vs when standard encoding is fine

**Safe to use basic URL encoding (e.g. via `urllib.parse.quote` directly):** the message has none of `&`, `%`, `=`, `+` (most short personal messages). For these, the basic approach is fine and saves a few lines of Python.

**Must use fullwidth substitution:** any message containing `&`, `%`, `=`, or `+`. Default to always-on — the cost is ~5 lines of Python either way.

**Diagnostic if the user reports a truncated message:**
1. Inspect the URL — does the body contain `%26`? If yes, the link was built without the fullwidth workaround. Rebuild it.
2. Does the body contain `％` (`%EF%BC%85`)? That's the fullwidth percent — means the workaround was applied correctly. The user is seeing a different bug.

## Fullwidth Ampersand Sanity Test

```python
def safe_whatsapp_link(phone, message):
    # Apply fullwidth substitution FIRST
    message = message.replace('&', '\uFF06')
    message = message.replace('%', '\uFF05')
    message = message.replace('=', '\uFF1D')
    message = message.replace('+', '\uFF0B')
    # Sanity checks
    assert '\uFF06' in message or '&' not in message, "fullwidth & substitution failed"
    assert '\uFF05' in message or '%' not in message, "fullwidth % substitution failed"
    encoded = urllib.parse.quote(message, safe='')
    base = "https://api.whatsapp.com/send"
    if phone:
        return f"{base}?phone={phone}&text={encoded}"
    return f"{base}?text={encoded}"
```

## Verification (last good link, Jul 2026)

`https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Hi%20Eshwari%2C...` — body has no `&`, so direct encoding is safe. Worked end-to-end.

When the user message had no `&` but used punctuation like "—" (em dash) or "₹" (rupee), direct encoding worked fine — these are safe characters.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Forgetting to check for `&` in proper names** — e.g. "Dr X & Dr Y", "Eshwari & Roshni", "M&A". The user often doesn't notice the `&` in the draft until the link truncates.
2. **Percent signs in prices** — "₹25,000" is fine, but "25% discount" is not. Use fullwidth.
3. **Plus signs in amounts or phone refs** — "Class 10+1", "+91 98800 55634" in body text.
4. **Equals signs in "Dr=DW" type shorthand** — uncommon but possible.

## When in Doubt, Always Apply the Fullwidth Recipe

The cost of always applying it is ~5 lines of Python. The cost of forgetting it is a broken link and a frustrated user. Default to always-on.

## Telegram Renders wa.me Links as Markdown — Hidden Pitfall

**Different bug, same symptom (Nishant, 12 Jul 2026):** Standard URL encoding produces a perfectly valid wa.me URL with correct URL-encoding (`%28` for `(`, `%27` for `'`, `%29` for `)`, `%E2%80%94` for em-dash). The URL itself is fine. But **Telegram's Markdown parser** sees the link text inside a markdown message and **mismatches the URL boundaries** — it stops at the first `)` it finds, treats everything after as garbage, and the visible "link" is truncated.

**Root cause:** Telegram treats the wa.me link text as inline Markdown. The text inside the wa.me URL often contains punctuation that Telegram interprets as Markdown link syntax: `[text](url)` ends at the first `)`. When the message body has `(...)`, Telegram thinks the URL ends at the closing paren.

**Three characters that break Telegram rendering** (URL is correct, but Telegram truncates the visible link):

| Character | Example in message | Telegram effect |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| `(` and `)` | `(#9, #13, #15, #16, #25)` | URL parsing stops at first `)`, rest is junk |
| `'` (apostrophe) | `I've sent you` | Sometimes breaks the link rendering |
| Unbalanced brackets in `[...]` | rare, but possible | Same truncation |

**Rule — when delivering a wa.me link as Telegram chat text:**

1. **Sanitize the message body before generating the link.** Replace `(...)` with ` — ` (em-dash) or ` - ` (hyphen), and `'X` → `X`. Examples:
   - `(#9, #13, #15, #16, #25)` → `items 9, 13, 15, 16, 25`
   - `I've sent you` → `I have sent you`
   - `Viewer (read-only)` → `Viewer / read-only`
2. **Generate the link with the SANITIZED text** using the fullwidth recipe via `execute_code` (see the "Correct Approach" section above). The receiver will see the sanitized version in WhatsApp — if that loses meaning, consider a non-wa.me link (e.g. `gmail-compose` URL, Drive link, or plain text).
3. **Display the link in a code block in Telegram** if you must keep the original punctuation. Code blocks suppress Markdown processing:
   ```
   https://wa.me/9844123300?text=...
   ```
   The link won't be clickable in a code block, but at least the full URL is visible.
4. **Do NOT** edit the URL itself to escape these characters — wa.me and WhatsApp expect literal `(`, `)`, `'` in the decoded text. The fix is in the **text payload**, not the URL.

**Diagnostic if the user says "the link is broken / truncated":**
- Inspect the Telegram message text — does it contain `(`, `)`, `'`?
- If yes: rebuild the message with the sanitized version.
- The wa.me URL itself was probably always correct.

**Independent of the `&` / `%` / `=` / `+` fullwidth issue** — those break on mobile WhatsApp, this one breaks on Telegram. Both can affect the same link. Sanitize for BOTH channels:

```python
# Build a Telegram-safe + WhatsApp-safe message
text = text.replace("(", "").replace(")", "")  # remove parens
text = text.replace("'", "")                    # remove apostrophes
# Then apply the fullwidth substitution for &, %, =, +
text = text.replace('&', '\uFF06').replace('%', '\uFF05').replace('=', '\uFF1D').replace('+', '\uFF0B')
import urllib.parse
encoded = urllib.parse.quote(text, safe='')
link = f"https://wa.me/919844123300?text={encoded}"
```
