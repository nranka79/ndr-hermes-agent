# Voice Entity Resolution — Absorbed from domain/voice-entity-resolution

## What This Reference Covers

Handles voice message entity resolution — the full 4-phase workflow for extracting project/land/entity context from voice messages before routing to contacts.

**Skill status:** Absorbed into `messaging-drafts` umbrella (2026-05-29). Original at `domain/voice-entity-resolution/`.

## When to Use

Activate on every voice message:
```
[The user sent a voice message~ Here's what they said: "..."]
```

## 4-Phase Resolution Workflow

### Phase 0 — Inline Number Detection
Before any resolution, scan for `+91` or 10-digit Indian mobile patterns.
If name AND number provided together → skip Phase 2/3, proceed directly.

### Phase 1 — Project/Land/Entity Context
1. Check for ordinal references ("folder #2", "file #3") — these are **session-specific**, never reuse numbering from prior sessions
2. Search projects, land_proposals, entities sheets for fuzzy match
3. Confirm before proceeding

### Phase 2 — Contact Resolution via Entity Context
For each confirmed project/entity row, read its associated_contacts column to narrow who the message is about.

### Phase 3 — Fallback Full Contact Search
Use `contacts-lookup` skill when person not in entity's associated contacts.

### Phase 4 — Mandatory Final Confirmation Before Any Action
Present complete summary of ALL entities and contacts before executing any send/write tool.

## Key Rules

- **NEVER** start Phase 2 without confirming Phase 1
- **NEVER** call any send/write tool before Phase 4 confirmation
- **NEVER** use People API (`contacts people search`) — it is disabled; use `contact_resolver` instead
- **NEVER** use the STT/user-typed name in drafted messages — always use the canonical name
- **ALWAYS** extract ALL person references from transcript — there may be more than one

## Known STT Corrections (pre-loaded)

| STT heard | Correct | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| "Chirchiganapalini" | Chichuraganapalli, Tamil Nadu 635103 | Serenity Estate, NOT Bangalore |
| "Chikabhо Navatvara" | Chichuraganapalli, Tamil Nadu 635103 | Cyrillic artifact in transcription |
| "reverse stolen" | Riverstone Farms | STT error from prior session |
| "ragoo" | Raghu Iyer | Voice phonetic variant |
| "Unverson" / "Umbhurasen" | Anbarasan Murugaperumal (Anbu) | STT garbled full name — Anbu is DRA employee, on Telegram |
| "Anjali Muruga Perumal" | Anjali Murugaperumal | NOT Anbarasan — this is his **sister** (different person, same surname). They share the Murugaperumal surname. Phone: +919791179561 (old) / user may have newer number. |
| "Shranta" | Piyush | Advocate name — "Piyush" misheard as "Shranta". Confirm with client before sending. |
| "Somaya" | Sumeya / Sumaya | User phonetically spelled "SU-MA-Y" syllable-by-syllable to correct. When user syllables out a name (he-she-they-it says "X-Y-Z" or "SU-MA-Y"), capture it as the canonical spelling. |
| "Akbar" | Akber | M.Akber Hussain (akber@ahindia.com) — Miller's Road lease co-owner. Voice adds intrusive 'r'. PA Director Atheeq (padirector@ahindia.com). |

## ⚠️ Pitfall — Surname Equivalence Trap (Same Surname ≠ Same Person)

**Trigger:** User says a full name (e.g., "Anjali Murugaperumal") and you find someone in recent context who shares the same surname ("Anbarasan Murugaperumal").

**Problem:** You've been interacting with Person A (same surname) in the recent conversation. When the user mentions Person B (different given name, same surname), your recent-context bias makes you assume they're the same person or a voice-garbled variant of Person A. This wastes time and confuses the user.

**Common Indian family name pattern:** Multiple family members (siblings, parents, cousins) share the same surname. A voice transcription of a sibling's name sounds like a garbled version of the person you've already been talking to.

**Fix:**
1. When the user provides a FULL NAME (given + surname), trust that it's a distinct person — don't map it to a known contact just because the surname matches.
2. Cross-check the given name (first name) independently in contacts and Gmail.
3. If the expected person (the one you've been talking to) has a DIFFERENT given name, they are likely a different individual.
4. Search for the full given name in People API and contacts before assuming it's a variant.
5. Only if no record exists at all should you ask the user for clarification.

**Real example (June 2026):** User said "Anjali Muruga Perumal" (sister of Anbu). Because I had just messaged "Anbarasan Murugaperumal (Anbu)" moments earlier, I assumed "Anjali" was a mispronunciation of "Anbarasan." The user corrected: it was his sister, not him. Had I searched People API for "Anjali" independently, I would have found her separate contact entry with her own phone number.

## How to Save Corrections

After task completion, if user corrected any misheard name:
```python
from skills.noun_learner import handle_correction
handle_correction(sheet_type="projects", row=ROW, misspelling="reverse stolen")
```
