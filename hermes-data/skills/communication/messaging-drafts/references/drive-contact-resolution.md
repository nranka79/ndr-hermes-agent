# Drive-Based Contact Resolution (When Contact Not in Sheet)

## Problem

The contact (seller, buyer, or counterparty in a property transaction) is **not in the Google Contacts sheet**. No sheet match found.

## Solution: Search Drive Property Documents

Property transaction documents in Drive often contain the counterparty's full name, PAN, Aadhaar, and address — which includes a phone number or at minimum enough detail to construct a wa.me link for initial outreach.

**Workflow:**

1. Search Drive for the property project/flat folder (e.g., "914 Embassy Habitat")
2. List files in that folder — look for:
   - Sale Agreement (PDF, Google Doc)
   - Legal Opinion / Due Diligence report
   - Cover letter or correspondence
3. Download and OCR the document (see `ocr-and-documents` skill — `pdf2image` + `tesseract` for scanned PDFs)
4. Extract the counterparty's details from the text
5. Use the address/location to confirm identity, then construct the WhatsApp message

**This session's example — Ravi Kumar (EH9 Seller):**

**Note:** Ravi Kumar was not found in the contacts sheet. His details were extracted from the Drive documents.

## Drive Search Pattern for Property Transactions

```python
service = build_service("drive", "v3")
results = service.files().list(
    q="name contains '914' or name contains 'EH9' or name contains 'Embassy Habitat'",
    fields="files(id, name, mimeType, parents)",
    pageSize=20
).execute()
```

Then list the parent folder contents to find all transaction documents:
```python
results = service.files().list(
    q="'{folder_id}' in parents",
    fields="files(id, name, mimeType)",
    pageSize=50
).execute()
```

**SA key vs OAuth for Drive search:**
- Use `tools.gws_auth.build_service("drive", "v3")` for per-user OAuth (user's own Drive files)
- Use `tools.gws_sa.build_service("drive", "v3", "ndr@draas.com")` for shared DRA Drive files
- Both support the same `files().list()` API — the difference is credentials source only
